ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Interactive Array Sorting Visualizer ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to share a project I recently worked on: A Web-based Array Sorting Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool helps users learn about various sorting algorithms in an interactive way!

Key Features:

Visual Representation: The sorting algorithms are visually represented through bars, which dynamically adjust their heights during the sorting process.

Multiple Sorting Algorithms: It includes algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

Real-time Updates: View sorting in action with real-time updates on time taken for each algorithm.

User Experience: A smooth user interface where users can click buttons to visualize the sorting process for each algorithm.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Libraries: None (Pure vanilla JS)

Interactive Features: Animation with real-time updates for each sorting step

Why This Project? This was a fun way to explore the inner workings of sorting algorithms and how they can be visually represented. It also helped me dive deeper into JavaScript animations, improving my understanding of both algorithm design and UI/UX.

ðŸ’¡ I learned a lot about optimizing performance and making sure the user experience remains smooth even for complex algorithms!

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on improving this project! ðŸ‘‡
